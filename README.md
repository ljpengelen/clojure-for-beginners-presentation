# Clojure for Beginners

This small project serves as a presentation of the basics of Clojure.
I made it for [devConf 2022](https://devconf.nl/).

This presentation refers to the following repositories:
 - https://github.com/ljpengelen/clojure-for-beginners
 - https://github.com/ljpengelen/clojurescipt-rsi

## Trying this at home

If you're a beginner to Clojure and don't have a favorite setup yet, I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in combination with the [Calva extension](https://calva.io/).

Once you've installed Clojure, Visual Studio Code, and Calva, you can just open `src/presentation.clj`, [connect Calva to the project](https://calva.io/connect/), and start evaluating expressions.
